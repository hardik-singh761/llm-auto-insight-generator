Project Title

LLM-Based Auto Insight Generator for Datasets

Problem Statement

With the growing availability of structured datasets, users increasingly rely on data visualization tools to understand patterns and trends. However, interpreting charts and datasets still requires analytical skills and domain knowledge. Most existing visualization tools focus only on displaying data visually and do not provide automatic explanations or insights, making data interpretation difficult for non-technical users.

Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a system that automatically analyzes datasets, generates meaningful visualizations, and provides brief, human-readable explanations of the data and charts using a Large Language Model (LLM). The system aims to simplify data understanding and reduce the effort required for manual analysis.

Scope of the Project

Accepts structured datasets in CSV format

Performs basic statistical analysis automatically

Generates appropriate visualizations based on data types

Produces short, easy-to-understand explanations of data trends

Displays results through an interactive interface

The project focuses on exploratory data analysis and does not aim to replace professional data analysts.
